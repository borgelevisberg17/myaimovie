## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine. It is recommended to use a Node Version Manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage different Node.js versions.

### Running the Project

To start the development server, run the following command:

This will start the development server, and you can view the website in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`. The server will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.

## Building for Production

To create a production build of the website, run:
